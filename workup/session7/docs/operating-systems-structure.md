# Operating System Structure

Operating systems consist of a `Kernel` and a set of `utilities` which operate in `user space`.

The figure below highlights some of the key components in the Linux operating system.

A key aspect of Linux is that there are many choices which can be made as to which libraries are used to provide services in a particular system.

The Kernel is the minimal viable set of processes which provide the core operating system services.
This includes the scheduler, device drivers, virtual memory management and file systems.
