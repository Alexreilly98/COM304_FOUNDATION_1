# Session 9 The Internet and Networking

In this session we will begin looking at how computer networking works.

Start with [Introduction to Networking](../session9/docs/introduction-to-networking.md)

Then try the exercises in [Networking Exercises](../session9/docs/networking-exercises.md)

To connect with your pi remotely, try the  exercises in [VNC, SSH and remote connect](../session9/docs/remoteAccessSSHVNCPiConnect.md)

Finally try using a network protocol analyser in [Wireshark Experiments](../session9/docs/wireshark.md) to examine network traffic in and out of your Pi.
