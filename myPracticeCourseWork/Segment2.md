## computer languages

Machine code "a low-level programming language that instructs a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on how to run programs"
Binary instructions to control the CPU, not really "used" as extremely diffcult to get perfect, Still a vital part as assembly code translates to machine code

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code - most simple but detailed write up i could find 

Assembly code "a low-level programming language that corresponds to machine language instructions"
A simpler way for a programmer to give instructions to the CPU (machine code)
Still very simple and basic but makes alot more sense than machine code, Still lots of room for improvment still very limited

# High Level Languages
There are many many many high level languages such as C, Java or BASIC
These languages make it a lot easier for programmers to make more complicated programs as its far more readable, managable and maintanable.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z6x26yc/revision/1 - relevant to all things above, explained very simply very quickly, but makes it all make sense!

interpreted languages - Changes to object code one line at a time
Compiled languages - Converts whole code to machine code before running

## Open source vs Closed
 Very simple

 Open source - Openly distrubuted anyone can use
 Closed source - Not openly distrubted can not be re used

 https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/open-source - history of open source
 Three cheers for Richard Stallman!

 ## Subroutines and stacks
A small piece of code that can be called upon over and over by the main program
https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zh66pbk/revision/7#:~:text=Subroutines%20are%20smaller%2C%20named%20sections,points%20in%20the%20main%20program. once again simple quick but makes sense!

Stacks Store subroutine states, when new data is added the "stack pointer" is pushed to the next open space in the "stack" it can then be removed with a "pop" 

## interrupts

to put it simply, a interrupt interrupts the CPU, Which causing the CPU to jump to a subroutine before returning back to its previous task
for example, A user input from a mouse or keyboard
