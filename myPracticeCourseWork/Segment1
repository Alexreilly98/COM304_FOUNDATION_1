# **Session 1**

## A short history of Computing, Github, Project Plans and starting with a raspberry Pi

I was unforunately a late starter so I was not in attendance for this lesson, However I caught up at a later date

We covered a quick glimpse into the history of computing, starting from the Abacus "a simple device for calculating, consisting of a frame with rows of wires or grooves along which beads are slid." all the way up to "cloud" computing

Quick video I found that gives a quick but detailed version of this "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M6lANfzFsM&ab_channel=Futurology%E2%80%94AnOptimisticFuture"
