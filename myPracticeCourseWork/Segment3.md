### Session 9

## Networking

IP = Internet Protocool = Rules that govern how data is routed across networks
packets = Small bits of data contatining multiple Bytes
Interface = Ports = e.g Wifi interface or wired interface
router = Routes packets 


PC - Switch - Gateway Router - Core provider network(routers) - Gateway router(on destination network) - Switch - PC/Server

## Network Protocool layers

https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zr3yb82/revision/4 Explains better than i'll ever write notes about 

Four layers
Application layer - e.g HTTP, SMTP, FTP
Transport Layer - e.g Transmission Control Protocool (TCP), User Datagram Protcool(UDP)
Network layer - e.g IPv4, ICMP(For errors and diagnostics), ARP(Maps ethernet adresses to IP)
Link layer - e.g Ethernet, (PPP) Point-to-point(Dial up)

Listent to this a few times to get it in! Explains the 4 layers along with the 7 OSI model
